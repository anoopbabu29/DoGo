## Inspiration
In order for people to search for nonprofits and charities, especially for donating.

## What it does
It is a search engine that searches for the donation and web scrapes a website that describes them (All parts connected in final form).

## How we built it
Front end was made with reactJS and materialUI, and the backend was made with golang.

## Challenges we ran into
Many of the places that I webscraped didn't like that I web scraped, so I had to either be creative or look for alternatives.

## Accomplisdhments that we're proud of
Web scraping at all

## What we learned
Web Scraping

## What's next for DoGo
Connect it! Also, having more accurate information about the website describing them and fine tuning other metrics.
